# Warehouse Management System

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project designed to streamline order processing within the packing and shipping department of a warehouse. It helps manage and optimize various stages of order fulfillment.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. You can edit `src/app/page.tsx` to make changes and see them reflected live.

## Running Tests

This project uses **Jest** for testing. To run the tests:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the tests with:

Jest will automatically find and execute all test files (those ending in `.test.tsx` or `.test.js`).
